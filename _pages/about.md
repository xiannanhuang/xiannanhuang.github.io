I am a Ph.D. candidate in Transportation Engineering at Tongji University, advised by Prof. Chao Yang. My research focuses on **online learning for traffic demand prediction**, **uncertainty quantification**, and **causal inference in urban mobility systems**.

My recent work includes:
- **Adapt-z**: Online time series prediction using feature adjustment (ICLR,2026)
- **CONTINA**: Confidence intervals with coverage guarantee for traffic forecasting (TR-C, 2026)
- Causal analysis of subway accidents and passenger flow disruption (TRB Annual Meeting 2025, Oral)
- Multi-period feature modeling for subway passenger flow prediction (TRB 2024 / arXiv:2410.14727)
